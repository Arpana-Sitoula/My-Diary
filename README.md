# My diary
This web application holds the personal information of users from their daily routine to weekly journals. 
This is based on MERN stack technology, where all the entries are stored on server and can be accessed easily from anywhere.
To protect the confidential information of users, we will be using user validation through password. 

# Run project
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in a development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The best way to do it is by using:
### `npm run build`
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
